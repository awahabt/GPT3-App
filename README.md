# GPT-3 React Project

This repository hosts a GPT-3 based interactive website built using React. The project showcases the integration of OpenAI's GPT-3 with a modern front-end framework to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. Users can interact with the AI model directly through the website, which demonstrates capabilities such as natural language understanding, text generation, and real-time response handling.
